Allows removal of all dashboard panels, add your own custom panel, insert custom logos in header/footer and login page.

== Description ==
The White Label CMS plugin allows you to remove all the panels from the Wordpress dashboard and insert your own panel, which you can use to write a personalised message to your client and link to the important elements in the CMS.

It also allows you to add custom logos to the header and footer as well as the all important login page, giving your client a better branded experience of using their new website.

There is also the option to hide the nag updates as well.

No longer will you have to tell your clients to ignore the dashboard!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Who is this plugin for?=
For developers who handover websites to their clients and use Wordpress as a CMS.

=How to I add links to my own panel?=
Your custom panel accepts html, so just write the markup as you normally would in html.

=How do you recommend using this plugin?=
We have been using this for a number of months now, and we have found clients respond best when it is set up in the following fashion:

* Use the clients logo for the login (it gives the CMS a bit of a wow factor!)
* Use the clients logo in the header
* Use your own logo in the footer, and place a link back to your website
* Remove all panels from the dashboard (they have a lot of information that just confuses the client)
* Add your own panel. Personalise the experience for your client by welcoming them to their website. Provide links to the most relevant elements in the CMS. Provide a link back to your support system if you have one.
